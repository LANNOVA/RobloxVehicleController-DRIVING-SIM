# Roblox Mini-Game Vehicle Control Script

This repository contains a Roblox Lua script for controlling a vehicle in a mini-game. The script allows players to control the throttle, steering, and stopping of a vehicle based on collisions with specific parts in the game.

## Script Functionality

The script provides the following functionality:

- Throttle control: The script sets the throttle of the vehicle to a value of 1, allowing the vehicle to move forward.
- Steering control: When the vehicle collides with a part named "Turn", the script sets the steering of the vehicle to a value of 1.50 for 1.5 seconds, causing the vehicle to turn.
- Stopping control: When the vehicle collides with a part named "RedPart", the script sets the throttle of the vehicle to 0, stopping the vehicle.
- Restart control: When the vehicle collides with a part named "GreenPart", the script resets the throttle to 1, allowing the vehicle to move forward again.

## Usage

3. Place the Script object into the appropriate part of your mini-game, such as attaching it to the vehicle or a relevant game object.
4. Adjust the part names and positions in the script code to match the parts in your mini-game that you want to use for collision detection and vehicle control.
